Pain abilities only apply to a unit while it is Empowered. If your Army Faction is **^^Drukhari^^**, you can Empower units from your army with Pain abilities by spending Pain tokens (see below).

**GAINING PAIN TOKENS**

If your Army Faction is **^^Drukhari^^**, you gain Pain tokens as follows:
■ 1 Pain token at the start of your Command phase.
■ 1 Pain token each time an enemy unit is destroyed.
■ 1 Pain token each time an enemy unit fails a Battle-shock test.

Each time you gain a Pain token, keep it to one side – this is your Pain token pool. Each time you spend a Pain token, reduce your Pain token pool by the same amount.

**EMPOWERED THROUGH PAIN**

Each Pain ability will state when you can spend Pain tokens to Empower that unit. When you do, until the end of the phase, that unit is Empowered and all Pain abilities it has take effect. While an Attached unit is Empowered, the Pain abilities of all Leader and Bodyguard units in that unit take effect - you do not need to spend additional Pain tokens to activate each of those Pain abilities.</description></rule></rules><profiles><profile id="88a6-91eb-ecd3-fe5b" name="Leader" hidden="false" typeId="9cc3-6d83-4dd3-9b64" typeName="Abilities" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Description" typeId="9b8f-694b-e5e-b573">This model can be attached to the following unit:

In such circumstances, a Pistol can target an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within Engagement Range of the same enemy unit. 

If a model is equipped with one or more Pistols, unless it is a **^^Monster^^** or **^^Vehicle^^** model, it can either shoot with its Pistols or with all of its other ranged weapons. Declare whether such a model will shoot with its Pistols or its other ranged weapons before selecting targets.</description></rule></rules><profiles><profile id="adb5-71f4-43ef-dba0" name="Splinter pistol" hidden="false" typeId="f77d-b953-8fa4-b762" typeName="Ranged Weapons" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Range" typeId="9896-9419-16a1-92fc">12&quot;</characteristic><characteristic name="A" typeId="3bb-c35f-f54-fb08">1</characteristic><characteristic name="BS" typeId="94d-8a98-cf90-183e">2+</characteristic><characteristic name="S" typeId="2229-f494-25db-c5d3">2</characteristic><characteristic name="AP" typeId="9ead-8a10-520-de15">0</characteristic><characteristic name="D" typeId="a354-c1c8-a745-f9e3">1</characteristic><characteristic name="Keywords" typeId="7f1b-8591-2fcf-d01c">Anti-Infantry 3+, Assault, Pistol</characteristic></characteristics></profile></profiles><categories><category id="e106-0758-7137-2432" name="Assault Weapon" entryId="e106-0758-7137-2432" primary="false" /></categories></selection></selections><costs><cost name="pts" typeId="51b2-306e-1021-d207" value="80" /></costs><categories><category id="9cfd-1c32-585f-7d5c" entryId="9cfd-1c32-585f-7d5c" name="Character" primary="true" /><category id="cf47-a0d7-7207-29dc" name="Infantry" entryId="cf47-a0d7-7207-29dc" primary="false" /><category id="fa4-eae-8e9e-1921" name="Kabal" entryId="fa4-eae-8e9e-1921" primary="false" /><category id="e035-51fc-813a-1313" name="Aeldari" entryId="e035-51fc-813a-1313" primary="false" /><category id="6c05-f06f-9b9f-890d" name="Archon" entryId="6c05-f06f-9b9f-890d" primary="false" /><category id="1015-db48-a2fa-c7da" name="Faction: Drukhari" entryId="1015-db48-a2fa-c7da" primary="false" /></categories></selection><selection id="jrh6nk" name="Succubus" entryId="70b6-9051-a20e-365f::b5a9-c802-10f0-6768" number="1" type="model" from="entry"><rules><rule id="5e02-2ddc-f55-e6dd" name="Power from Pain" hidden="false"><description>All **^^Drukhari^^** units have a Pain ability, tagged with the word 'Pain'. Pain abilities only apply to a unit while it is Empowered. If your Army Faction is **^^Drukhari^^**, you can Empower units from your army with Pain abilities by spending Pain tokens (see below).

**GAINING PAIN TOKENS**

If your Army Faction is **^^Drukhari^^**, you gain Pain tokens as follows:
■ 1 Pain token at the start of your Command phase.
■ 1 Pain token each time an enemy unit is destroyed.
■ 1 Pain token each time an enemy unit fails a Battle-shock test.

Each time you gain a Pain token, keep it to one side – this is your Pain token pool. Each time you spend a Pain token, reduce your Pain token pool by the same amount.

**EMPOWERED THROUGH PAIN**

Each Pain ability will state when you can spend Pain tokens to Empower that unit. When you do, until the end of the phase, that unit is Empowered and all Pain abilities it has take effect. While an Attached unit is Empowered, the Pain abilities of all Leader and Bodyguard units in that unit take effect - you do not need to spend additional Pain tokens to activate each of those Pain abilities.</description></rule></rules><profiles><profile id="630b-2f22-22c9-d034" name="Succubus" hidden="false" typeId="c547-1836-d8a-ff4f" typeName="Unit" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="M" typeId="e703-ecb6-5ce7-aec1">8&quot;</characteristic><characteristic name="T" typeId="d29d-cf75-fc2d-34a4">3</characteristic><characteristic name="SV" typeId="450-a17e-9d5e-29da">6+</characteristic><characteristic name="W" typeId="750a-a2ec-90d3-21fe">4</characteristic><characteristic name="LD" typeId="58d2-b879-49c7-43bc">7+</characteristic><characteristic name="OC" typeId="bef7-942a-1a23-59f8">1</characteristic></characteristics></profile><profile id="6321-2580-8edf-b106" name="Invulnerable Save" hidden="false" typeId="9cc3-6d83-4dd3-9b64" typeName="Abilities" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Description" typeId="9b8f-694b-e5e-b573">This unit has a 4+ Invulnerable save</characteristic></characteristics></profile><profile id="3293-85bb-5c8-eace" name="Lithe Agility (Pain)" hidden="false" typeId="9cc3-6d83-4dd3-9b64" typeName="Abilities" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Description" typeId="9b8f-694b-e5e-b573">In your Movement phase when you select this model's unit to Advance, or in your Charge phase before you make a Charge roll for this model's unit, you can spend 1 Pain token to Empower that unit.

Pain abilities only apply to a unit while it is Empowered. If your Army Faction is **^^Drukhari^^**, you can Empower units from your army with Pain abilities by spending Pain tokens (see below).

**GAINING PAIN TOKENS**

If your Army Faction is **^^Drukhari^^**, you gain Pain tokens as follows:
■ 1 Pain token at the start of your Command phase.
■ 1 Pain token each time an enemy unit is destroyed.
■ 1 Pain token each time an enemy unit fails a Battle-shock test.

Each time you gain a Pain token, keep it to one side – this is your Pain token pool. Each time you spend a Pain token, reduce your Pain token pool by the same amount.

**EMPOWERED THROUGH PAIN**

Each Pain ability will state when you can spend Pain tokens to Empower that unit. When you do, until the end of the phase, that unit is Empowered and all Pain abilities it has take effect. While an Attached unit is Empowered, the Pain abilities of all Leader and Bodyguard units in that unit take effect - you do not need to spend additional Pain tokens to activate each of those Pain abilities.</description></rule></rules><profiles><profile id="8e6f-11d-c8ca-df7c" name="Wracks" hidden="false" typeId="c547-1836-d8a-ff4f" typeName="Unit" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="M" typeId="e703-ecb6-5ce7-aec1">7&quot;</characteristic><characteristic name="T" typeId="d29d-cf75-fc2d-34a4">4</characteristic><characteristic name="SV" typeId="450-a17e-9d5e-29da">5+</characteristic><characteristic name="W" typeId="750a-a2ec-90d3-21fe">2</characteristic><characteristic name="LD" typeId="58d2-b879-49c7-43bc">7+</characteristic><characteristic name="OC" typeId="bef7-942a-1a23-59f8">2</characteristic></characteristics></profile><profile id="3659-8dfc-88b-e432" name="Torturer’s Craft" hidden="false" typeId="9cc3-6d83-4dd3-9b64" typeName="Abilities" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Description" typeId="9b8f-694b-e5e-b573">In your Shooting phase and the Fight phase, after this unit has shot or fought, select one enemy unit (excluding ^^**Vehicles**^^) hit by one or more of those attacks.
