During your Shooting phase, for each Observer unit from your army that has not been selected to shoot this phase and is eligible to shoot (excluding **^^Fortification^^** and Battle‑shocked units) select one enemy unit that is visible to be marked as their Spotted unit until the end of the phase. Each enemy unit can only be marked as a Spotted unit once per phase.

Units from your army with the For the Greater Good ability (excluding Observer units) are Guided units while targeting one or more Spotted units.

Until the end of the phase, each time a model from your army in a Guided unit makes an attack that targets a Spotted unit, improve the Ballistic Skill characteristic of that attack by 1 and, if the Spotted unit was marked by an Observer unit that has the Markerlight keyword, that attack has the **[IGNORES COVER]** ability.</description></rule></rules><profiles><profile id="5084-6451-3fe5-37aa" name="Ghostkeel Battlesuit" hidden="false" typeId="c547-1836-d8a-ff4f" typeName="Unit" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="M" typeId="e703-ecb6-5ce7-aec1">10&quot;</characteristic><characteristic name="T" typeId="d29d-cf75-fc2d-34a4">8</characteristic><characteristic name="SV" typeId="450-a17e-9d5e-29da">2+</characteristic><characteristic name="W" typeId="750a-a2ec-90d3-21fe">12</characteristic><characteristic name="LD" typeId="58d2-b879-49c7-43bc">7+</characteristic><characteristic name="OC" typeId="bef7-942a-1a23-59f8">3</characteristic></characteristics><attributes><attribute name="New Attribute Type" typeId="ee2c-fa85-08b6-ad86" /></attributes></profile><profile id="ff15-6f06-1824-ea0b" name="Stealth Drones" hidden="false" typeId="9cc3-6d83-4dd3-9b64" typeName="Abilities" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Description" typeId="9b8f-694b-e5e-b573">Twice per battle, after an attack has been allocated to this model, you can change the Damage characteristic of that attack to 0.
