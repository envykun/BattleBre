Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack successfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a Character model in that unit, even if that Character model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to Character models in that unit.

Each time the last model in a Bodyguard unit is destroyed, each CHARACTER unit that is part of that Attached unit becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks. 

Each time the last model in a CHARACTER unit that is attached to a Bodyguard unit is destroyed and there is not another CHARACTER unit attached, that Attached unit’s Bodyguard unit becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks. 

Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.</description></rule><rule id="b280-6105-5358-ba2e" name="Cabal of Sorcerers" hidden="false"><description>If your army Faction is ^^**Thousand Sons^^**, at the start of your Shooting phase, one or more models from your army with this ability can attempt Rituals.

Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if that attack scores a Critical Wound, no saving throw of any kind can be made against that attack (including invulnerable saving throws). Such attacks are only allocated to models after all other attacks made by the attacking unit have been allocated and resolved. After that attack is allocated and after any modifiers are applied, it inflicts a number of mortal wounds on the target equal to the Damage characteristic of that attack, instead of inflicting damage normally.</description></rule></rules><profiles><profile id="331-c78e-d974-9ea7" name="➤ Hellforged weapons - strike (Eldritch Vortex of E'taph)" hidden="false" typeId="8a40-4aaa-c780-9046" typeName="Melee Weapons" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Range" typeId="914c-b413-91e3-a132">Melee</characteristic><characteristic name="A" typeId="2337-daa1-6682-b110">6</characteristic><characteristic name="WS" typeId="95d1-95f-45b4-11d6">2+</characteristic><characteristic name="S" typeId="ab33-d393-96ce-ccba">9</characteristic><characteristic name="AP" typeId="41a0-1301-112a-e2f2">-2</characteristic><characteristic name="D" typeId="3254-9fe6-d824-513e">4</characteristic><characteristic name="Keywords" typeId="893f-9000-ccf7-648e">Devastating Wounds, Psychic</characteristic></characteristics></profile><profile id="3160-17ed-2610-b2dc" name="➤ Hellforged weapons - sweep (Eldritch Vortex of E'taph)" hidden="false" typeId="8a40-4aaa-c780-9046" typeName="Melee Weapons" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Range" typeId="914c-b413-91e3-a132">Melee</characteristic><characteristic name="A" typeId="2337-daa1-6682-b110">12</characteristic><characteristic name="WS" typeId="95d1-95f-45b4-11d6">2+</characteristic><characteristic name="S" typeId="ab33-d393-96ce-ccba">7</characteristic><characteristic name="AP" typeId="41a0-1301-112a-e2f2">-1</characteristic><characteristic name="D" typeId="3254-9fe6-d824-513e">2</characteristic><characteristic name="Keywords" typeId="893f-9000-ccf7-648e">Devastating Wounds, Psychic</characteristic></characteristics></profile></profiles><categories><category id="4546-4a0c-b3be-e84c" name="Psychic Weapon" entryId="4546-4a0c-b3be-e84c" primary="false" /><category id="ccdd-3987-11ed-90cd" name="Melee Weapon" entryId="ccdd-3987-11ed-90cd" primary="false" /></categories></selection><selection id="8vzclj" name="Infernal cannon" entryId="2d6b-f5cf-6f01-9475::2313-45a2-28ff-c81a" entryGroupId="2d6b-f5cf-6f01-9475::ed85-1f50-0f71-e9a8" number="1" type="upgrade" from="group" group="Wargear"><profiles><profile id="f3ac-4af-df82-2142" name="Infernal cannon" hidden="false" typeId="f77d-b953-8fa4-b762" typeName="Ranged Weapons" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Range" typeId="9896-9419-16a1-92fc">24&quot;</characteristic><characteristic name="A" typeId="3bb-c35f-f54-fb08">3</characteristic><characteristic name="BS" typeId="94d-8a98-cf90-183e">2+</characteristic><characteristic name="S" typeId="2229-f494-25db-c5d3">5</characteristic><characteristic name="AP" typeId="9ead-8a10-520-de15">-2</characteristic><characteristic name="D" typeId="a354-c1c8-a745-f9e3">2</characteristic><characteristic name="Keywords" typeId="7f1b-8591-2fcf-d01c">-</characteristic></characteristics></profile></profiles><categories><category id="eeda-8544-a2f3-3fab" name="Ranged Weapon" entryId="eeda-8544-a2f3-3fab" primary="false" /></categories></selection></selections><costs><cost name="pts" typeId="51b2-306e-1021-d207" value="170" /></costs><categories><category id="7002-1fbb-7571-e8e7" name="Faction: Thousand Sons" entryId="7002-1fbb-7571-e8e7" primary="false" /><category id="9693-cf84-fe69-37a9" name="Monster" entryId="9693-cf84-fe69-37a9" primary="false" /><category id="9cfd-1c32-585f-7d5c" entryId="9cfd-1c32-585f-7d5c" name="Character" primary="true" /><category id="9c0e-7e25-4580-e439" name="Daemon" entryId="9c0e-7e25-4580-e439" primary="false" /><category id="13bf-2bee-3ae0-b414" name="Psyker" entryId="13bf-2bee-3ae0-b414" primary="false" /><category id="4c00-2578-faf5-6918" name="Chaos" entryId="4c00-2578-faf5-6918" primary="false" /><category id="b188-114f-6ba5-79a1" name="Tzeentch" entryId="b188-114f-6ba5-79a1" primary="false" /><category id="4f09-0141-6c70-6c5a" name="Daemon Prince" entryId="4f09-0141-6c70-6c5a" primary="false" /><category id="c619-2086-bbcf-69c9" name="Fly" entryId="c619-2086-bbcf-69c9" primary="false" /></categories></selection><selection id="enz0mm" name="Infernal Master" entryId="fa01-afbc-eb36-3fcf::1693-5e00-da69-57bb" number="1" type="model" from="entry"><rules><rule id="b4dd-3e1f-41cb-218f" name="Leader" hidden="false" page="39"><description>While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed (pg 12), it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack successfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a Character model in that unit, even if that Character model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to Character models in that unit.

Each time the last model in a Bodyguard unit is destroyed, each CHARACTER unit that is part of that Attached unit becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks.
